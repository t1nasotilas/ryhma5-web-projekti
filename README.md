Game will ask you questions in random order with four different answer options.
When you select answer, you cannot change it anymore. If you choose correct, game will highlight it with green color, and show a pop-up fact about current question.
Whereas if you answer incorrectly, it will highlight your answer on red color and show right answer on green color.
After all questions have been answered, a summary page displays your total score (1 point per correct answer).
The summary page includes two buttons: one return to the overview page and another to restart the game.
